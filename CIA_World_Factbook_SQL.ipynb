    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The CIA World Factbook is a reference resource produced by the main intelligence agency in the United States, the CIA. It contains fundamental facts about history, economy, governments, geography, demography for each world country. Originally accessible only by US government officers, since 1971 a public domain version has been published. Nowadays it has a dedicated website; you can find it [here](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/). It's a constantly updated source of information and one of the most accesed websites of the US government.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we're going to analyse a subset of the World Factbook data regarding demographics and geography. **The dataset is contained in a single-table SQLite [database](https://dsserver-prod-resources-1.s3.amazonaws.com/257/factbook.db)** (<- by clicking you'll download it) and dates back to the 2015 edition.\n",
    "\n",
    "(<u>Note</u>: since this project was included in the Dataquest path, the data dictionary pages have apparently disappeared and we couldn't find any official documentation. Most columns in the table are self-explanatory and the consistency of the data can be checked; instead, the `migration rate` column requires attention. More on this in the third section.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project's goals**:\n",
    "* learning how to connect a database to a Jupyter notebook;\n",
    "* practice basic SQL commands, subqueries and SQL summary statistics tools;\n",
    "* investigate some demographic data about world countries; doing further research on some aspects which sparkled our curiosity.\n"

    "Japan had a **baby-boom** in the immediate aftermath of World War II, in the years 1947-49. After this, a prolonged period of low fertility followed, which still continues today. From the graph above, we see that the birth rate had a moderate recovery in the 60's, but after that the fall has been unstoppable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The birth rate crisis contributes to a larger phenomenon: **the aging of the country**. It is described in detail in this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging_of_Japan).<br />\n",
    "According to it, several factors contribute to Japan's growing share of elderly people (more than 20% of its population is older than 65 today). Some of them are:\n",
    "* **high life expectancy**: improved living conditions (healthcare, nutrition, prolonged peace) has led inevitably to a longer expected lifespan. In 2016, it was 85 years on average.\n",
    "* **low fertility rate**: it is defined as the expected number of children per woman during her lifetime. In the 2000's, it has gone under the \"replacement threshold\" of 2 children per woman. This factor clearly correlates to birth rate.\n",
    "    * **economic and cultural factors**: these can be considered a direct cause of low birth rate. Later and fewer marriages, poor work-life balance, decline in wages, higher costs in raising children are just some. Perhaps most importantly, in Japan a rising share of men (about 40%) have part-time and temporary jobs.<br />\n",
    "In this [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/07/japan-mystery-low-birth-rate/534291/) by The Atlantic, the author suggests that a country where men are still largely considered as breadwinners, the difficulties in findind steady jobs are perhaps the main obstacle to start building a family at a young age. Furthermore, those who have a stable job find themselves under the pressure of employers who ask them to work overtime very often in order to preserve their job. This way, having time, energy and will to date someone may be impossible, even for economically-secure workers (death by overwork is not so rare in Japan. They even a word for that: *karoshi*).<br />\n",
    "As an aside, we also note that with an increasingly old population, more pressure is put on young workers for paying pensions and healthcare for the elderly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem strictly connected to low birth rate is the **shrinking of the population**: during the 2000's, in Japan the death rate has regularly overcome the birth rate. This, combined with very low immigration rates, is causing a decrease in the population. We can have a glimpse of that in our data:"
